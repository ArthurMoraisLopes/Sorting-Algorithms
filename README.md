# Sorting-Algorithms
Repository in order to implement sorting algorithms in python 3.


In the computing world it is essential to deliver clean, well-structured code with a compilation process in the smallest and possible storage (but it is practically impossible to obtain all these results at the same time). Therefore, to obtain an efficient and optimized code (in order to achieve good results mentioned above, one must analyze the specific algorithms of each area and compare each one, being defined by search, ordering and others.

It is important to note that in order to have a plausible result, in relation to the compilation and storage process, the number of terms present in the algorithm is analyzed, since an algorithm of size 5 would always be less than 1000. Another fact would be the junction of the number of terms with complexity, BigOnotation notation, of the algorithm, whether for a medium or good case.

In this case, narrowing down the subject, we have the sorting algorithms: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort, the first 2 being recursive and the last 3 using only vectors.
